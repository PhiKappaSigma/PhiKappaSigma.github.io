	"Skullhouse is not your average college fraternity."
  </span></p></b>

	<p>
	Phi Kappa Sigma, known also as Skullhouse, is a fraternal society<br>
	that draws its membership from men of strong character and<br>
	high aspirations within the New York University undergraduate<br>
	community. We provide our members with a path of discovery<br>
	through a variety of talks, performances, events, food and<br>
	beverage tastings, and stimulating excursions – an ideal<br>
	environment for personal growth and intellectual enrichment.<br>
	</p>

	<p>
	Steeped in tradition, Skullhouse reflects the diversity of its<br>
	membership while addressing their current needs. Enthusiastic<br>
	member volunteers commit their skills and time to create this<br>
	appealing atmosphere. Over the years, through strong and active<br>
	committees, members have been the source of the inspiration and<br>
	leadership that ensures the Fraternity’s continued relevance and<br>
	importance to their lives.
	</p>

	<p>
	Through its selective admissions process and the vitality of its<br>
	members, Skullhouse has evolved into New York University’s<br>
	premier society for men who seek intellectual stimulation,<br>
	lifelong friendships, and a network of passionate individuals that<br>
	share common values.
