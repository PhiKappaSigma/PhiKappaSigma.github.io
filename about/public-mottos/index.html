  <h1>PUBLIC MOTTOS</h1>
	<hr>

	<p>
	Throughout the years the Brothers of Phi Kappa Sigma have come<br>
	to identify with phrases or sayings which hold deep meaning for<br>
	the organization and the members of it. These mottoes and their<br>
	explanations can be found below:
	</p>

	<p><b><span>“Stellis Aequus Durando”</span></b></p>
	<p>(Equal to the Stars in Endurance)</p>

	<p>
	Our Fraternity has endured suppression, countless wars, and myriad<br>
	other obstacles, yet remains strong. Since 1850, Phi Kappa Sigma<br>
	Fraternity has been a durable and everlasting organization that will<br>
	continue to succeed for many years to come.
	</p>

	<p><b><span>“Once a Phi Kap, Always a Phi Kap”</span></b></p>

	<p>
	Phi Kappa Sigma is more than an organization to be a part of during<br>
	your period of undergraduate studies; it is a valuable learning<br>
	experience, a life-long commitment, and a philosophy of life. Our<br>
	members graduate to become more than just productive members of<br>
	society, but leaders that possess a foundation built on steadfast<br>
	values and a duty to help their fellow man.
	</p>

	<p><b><span>“Brotherhood is more than skin deep”</span></b></p>

	<p>
	In 1860, a year before the outbreak of the American Civil War, the<br>
	Chapters of Phi Kappa Sigma unanimously voted against having an<br>
	all-white membership and thus became the first Fraternity to adopt a<br>
	national policy of nondiscrimination. Skulls choose men to become<br>
	members based on the worth of their character, not superficialities<br>
	such as race, religion, or sexual orientation.
