  <h1>CORE VALUES</h1>
	<hr>

	<p>
	We commit to the value of <b><span>Trust</span></b>, the foundation of a<br>
	relationship based on a belief in oneself as well as others,<br>
  which is earned and strengthened through experience. The value<br>
  of trust is found in our reliance on each other and enables an<br>
  open comfort in interacting with fellow Skulls.
	</p>

	<p>
	We commit to the value of <b><span>Honor</span></b>, staying true to a set<br>
  of higher standards and morals in the face of adversity.<br>
  Membership in Phi Kappa Sigma means a commitment to leading an honorable life.<br>
	</p>

	<p>
 	We commit to the value of <b><span>Respect</span></b>, which begins with<br>
  yourself and the practice of the golden rule, “Do unto others as<br>
  you would have them do unto you.” This statement is the acceptance<br>
  of the ideals of others.  In order to move forward as a brotherhood,<br>
  we must continue to consider each other’s points of view.<br>
	</p>

	<p>
	We commit to the value of <b><span>Knowledge</span></b>, the acquisition of<br>
	thought, theory, and principles following in the footsteps of our<br>
	Founding Fathers in accordance with our oath of Brotherhood.<br>
  With this knowledge we will come closer to self-discovery,<br>
  the improvement of society, and the translation of knowledge<br>
  into power.<br>
	</p>

	<p>
	We commit to the value of <b><span>Wisdom</span></b>, a virtue gained through<br>
	experiences of self and others.  Wisdom is the application of<br>
  knowledge and past experiences to make decisions regardless of<br>
  the situation. Through sharing wisdom, a bond is formed between<br>
  young and old, teacher and student; this bond is what brings us together.
	</p>

	<p>
	We commit to the value of <b><span>Responsibility</span></b>, by being reliable in<br>
	the fulfillment of the objectives of our Fraternity and our personal<br>
	obligations, enduring the consequences of our actions.<br>
	</p>

	<p>
	We commit to the value of <b><span>Integrity</span></b>, our inner foundation for<br>
	holding true to our values of trust, honor, respect, knowledge,<br>
  wisdom, and responsibility that guide us in living a life of virtue.<br>
