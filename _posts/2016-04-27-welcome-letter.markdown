<p>Dear Prospective Skull,</p>

<p>
  It is an honor that you are considering joining the Delta Phi<br>
  Chapter of the Phi Kappa Sigma Fraternity at New York University.<br>
  Skullhouse is always looking for socially adventurous and<br>
  intellectually curious members, and we look forward to making<br>
  your acquaintance!
</p>

<p>
  Despite the academic rigors of one of the nation’s most outstanding universities, the brothers of
  Phi Kappa Sigma have not only endured, but have thrived, finding success in their coursework
  and extracurricular activities. Like New York City itself, we are truly a diverse and cosmopolitan
  band of brothers — it’s almost a guarantee that someone in the Chapter shares your interest.
</p>

<p>
  The <a href="/brothers/">brothers</a> of Skullhouse are varsity sportsmen, first chair violinists, leaders in the university’s
  developer and technology communities, filmmakers, volunteer museum guides, avid sailors, and
  public policy case competitors. This summer, brothers secured internships developing apps for
  Microsoft, investigating campaign finance in DC, and consulting businesses for Pricewaterhouse
  Coopers. Our members come from as far away as Nanjing and as close as the Bronx.
</p>

<p>
  We are excited for recruitment this semester and invite you to be a part of the most tight-knit
  brotherhood on campus. To take the first step, please register for recruitment
  with the <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/nyu.edu/forms/d/1mdVOp7-OEeccS3DltkeYtkoJN3mVC1AyDWdrfSTlBf4/viewform?c=0&w=1">Interfraternity Council</a>.

<p>
  Welcome (back) to campus! Here’s to the start of a great year.
</p>

<p>
  Sincerely,<br>
  Bob Gardner<br>
  President, Phi Kappa Sigma
