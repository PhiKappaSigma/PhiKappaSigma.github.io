<h1>2016 Philanthropy Wrap-up</h1>
<p>
In terms of philanthropy, this past school year has been an eventful and
productive one for the Delta Phi Chapter of the Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity.
In the fall of 2015, we started the year of strongly with our Lambda Class
initiates participating in an Airbnb sponsored park cleanup in Long Island.
</p>

<p>
The brothers woke up bright and early and took the Staten Island Ferry over
to Fresh-kills Park on a sunny October morning. There, they picked up trash
and helped the Airbnb team spray paint mile markers for joggers and cyclists
that utilize the park. Later on in the semester, the whole fraternity put on
a Story Love event in conjunction with the Story Pirates organization.
The event saw brothers and NYU community members show up to write letters of
positive feedback on the creative writing projects of local elementary
school children.
</p>

<p>
In the Spring semester, we put on two more Story Love events. Both events
were a success, and we saw a number of brothers, friends, and NYU students
come to show their support for a worthy cause! At the end of the semester,
our Philanthropy Committee spearheaded a fundraising initiative during finals
week in support of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. During the week, our
brothers manned a stand where we sold coffee and donuts to energize students
for their exams. Our brothers enjoyed the chance to support an organization
dear to Phi Kappa Sigma.
</p>

<p>
For the next year, our fraternity has our sights on expanding our presence
at NYU by holding more philanthropy events and by participating in other
organizations' events. In the future, we will be running one large event for
each semester. Potential future Leukemia and Lymphoma Society fundraisers
include a sports tournament open to the greater NYU community, to holding a
hotdog eating contest at Washington Square Park, so keep an eye out for some
great fundraising events from us!
</p>

<p>
Finally, the brothers of Phi Kappa Sigma have shown a desire to participate
in the Dance Marathon event held at NYU during the Fall and the Relay For Life
event in the Spring. Both events are a staple of the greek community at NYU,
and showcase our commitment to help not just the causes that are dear to our
organisation, but also a commitment to help the other great causes advocated
by the greater greek community.
