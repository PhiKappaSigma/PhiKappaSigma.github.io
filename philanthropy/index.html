  <h1>Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society</h1>

  <p>
    One of the pillars of the Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity is the ideal of
    charity. This means doing as much as we can to give back to the community
    around us, through fundraising, attending/setting up charity events for
    the <span>Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society</span>, or writing encouraging
    letters for the children writing for the <span>Story Pirates</span>.
