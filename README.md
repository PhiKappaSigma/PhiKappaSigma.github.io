# [Skullhouse NYU Website](https://www.skullhouse.nyc)
By Jason Yao

## Description
Updated at the end of: *Spring 2016*

Online site for Phi Kappa Sigma's Delta Phi (New York University) chapter
at https://www.skullhouse.nyc. This site utilises the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
static site generator and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to be served.

## Upkeep
This section is for the future Omegas from Delta Phi, who would need to update the site later on.

### Downloading Project
```sh
git clone git@github.com:PhiKappaSigma/PhiKappaSigma.github.io.git
```
# TODO
### Updating Events
Retains modularity by allowing quick "hot-swapping" of events
```sh
cd resources/views/public/events
nano events.blade.php
# Replace fall2015 in the include line with whatever semester it is.
# CTRL + x + y to save your changes
```

Copies boiler plate of events for you to edit (replace YOUR_SEMESTER_HERE with whichever semester's events it is)
```sh
cp fall2015.blade.php YOUR_SEMESTER_HERE.blade.php
nano YOUR_SEMESTER_HERE.blade.php
# Your events here
# CTRL + x + y to save your changes
```
### Updating the initiation class options

```sh
cd resources/views/private
nano profileUpdate.blade.php # Again, doesn't matter which editor you use
# Scroll down until you get to the initiation class options, and then add the option
# e.g. currently latest initation class will be lambda, so scroll until lambda class option, and press enter for a new line
# Add the latest initiation class (e.g. after lambda it's Mu class)
# CTRL + x + y to save your changes
```
### Updating the brothers page

```sh
cd resources/views/public/brothers
nano dynamic.blade.php
# At the end, before the `</div>` tag, add underneath the other classes `@include('public.brothers.classes.CURRENT_INITIATION_CLASS_HERE')`
CTRL + x + y # Save your changes
cd classes
cp kappa.blade.php CURRENT_INITIATION_CLASS_HERE.blade.php
nano CURRENT_INITIATION_CLASS_HERE.blade.php
# Make your roster changes here, the template is pretty easy to follow and change
CTRL + x + y # Save your changes
```

# END TODO
