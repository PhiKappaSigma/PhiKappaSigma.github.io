<!-- Question 1 -->
<p>
  <span><strong>Question:</strong> What does the Skullhouse expect of someone looking to join?</span>
</p>

  <p>
  <strong>Answer:</strong> In Phi Kappa Sigma, we lay particular emphasis on the personal
    commitment of members to the Fraternity’s <a href="/about/core-values/">Core Values</a> and code of
    conduct, and expect members to set an example in on campus and in their
    communities by their conduct.

  <!-- Question 2 -->
 <p>
  <span><strong>Question:</strong> How much time and effort should I expect to give the Skullhouse?</span>
  </p>

  <p>
  <strong>Answer:</strong> In the tradition of the fraternal and secret society that Skullhouse
    originated as, ours is very much a working Fraternity. As such, full
    members are expected to attend weekly meetings and to support -
    according to their financial means and through their active
    participation - the Fraternity’s philanthropic, service, cultural,
    social, and traditional objectives. Ours is a lifelong brotherhood, and
    membership should not be taken lightly.

  <!-- Question 3 -->
 <p>
  <span><strong>Question:</strong> What status does the Skullhouse have nationally?</span>
  </p>

  <p>
  <strong>Answer:</strong> Phi Kappa Sigma is a founding member of the North-American
    Interfraternity Conference (NIC). We therefore have a responsibility to
    ensure that we maintain the standing and reputation of the Fraternity.

 <!-- Question 4 -->
 <p>
  <span><strong>Question:</strong> These are high expectations – what if I find it difficult to meet
    them?</span>
  </p>

  <p>
  <strong>Answer:</strong> We think it is right to aspire to high ideals in the Fraternity, but
    we recognize that everyone needs help and encouragement to achieve
    them. Experienced Skulls act as mentors to successful applicants and
    provide them with advice and support during their preparations for
    initiation and investiture. However, support does not cease there as
    all Skulls are encouraged to support and help one another in such a
    manner as to foster a good team spirit.

  <!-- Question 5 -->
 <p>
  <span><strong>Question:</strong> Does the Skullhouse accept applications from all undergraduate
    programs?</span>
  </p>

  <p>
  <strong>Answer:</strong> Yes – ours is a university-wide organization. We admit
    undergraduates from all majors, programs, and schools of New York
    University.

  <!-- Question 6 -->
 <p>
  <span><strong>Question:</strong> I plan on studying away for one or more semesters – can I still
    apply?</span>
  </p>

  <p>
  <strong>Answer:</strong> Yes. Many Skulls have studied abroad, and we expect future Skulls to
    continue in this tradition.

  <!-- Question 7 -->
 <p>
  <span><strong>Question:</strong> I am a transfer student, an upperclassman, or a veteran – can I
    still apply?</span>
  </p>

  <p>
  <strong>Answer:</strong> Yes. If you are enrolled full time as an undergraduate student at
    New York University, you are eligible for membership.
  </p>

  <!-- Question 8 -->
 <p>
  <span><strong>Question:</strong> What do membership dues pay for?</span>
  </p>

  <p>
  <strong>Answer:</strong> Membership dues pay for the Skullhouse’s operations and expenditures
    throughout the year. This includes insurance, apparel, and social,
    philanthropic, and service events.

  <!-- Question 9 -->
 <p>
  <span><strong>Question:</strong> What is rush week?</span>
  </p>

  <p>
  <strong>Answer:</strong> Rush Week, or simply “rush,” is a two week period every semester
    when each fraternity hosts events in order to meet potential new
    members (or “rushees”). The idea is for rushees to meet and mingle with
    the fraternities in order to find the group of men that suits them
    best, and then narrow their rushing efforts on the specific house they
    have the strongest affinity for.

  <!-- Question 10 -->
 <p>
  <span><strong>Question:</strong> What is a bid?</span>
  </p>

  <p>
  <strong>Answer:</strong> A bid is a formal invitation to join a fraternity. Some
    fraternities, like Skullhouse, present these as cards with the
    potential new member’s name or initials printed on it, and some present
    their bids via an in person conversation, email, or even by text
    message.
