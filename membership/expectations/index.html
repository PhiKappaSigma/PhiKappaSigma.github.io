  <h1>EXPECTATIONS</h1>
	<hr>

	<p>
        Membership in the Phi Kappa Sigma International Fraternity has<br>
		many privileges. With these rewards come obligations and<br>
		expectations that every Skull must fulfill. They are as follows:
        </p>

	<ol>
		<li>
	 	<p>
		I will strive for academic excellence and encourage it in my<br>
        	Brothers.
      		</p>
		</li>

		<li>
		<p>
		I will always respect other persons. I will refrain from and will<br>
		not tolerate physical, mental, psychological, sexual, or hazing<br>
		abuses to anyone, especially a fellow Skull.
		</p>
		</li>

		<li>
		<p>
		I will respect my own property and the property of others, and<br>
		I will not tolerate abuse of property by others.
		</p>
		</li>

		<li>
		<p>
		I will meet all financial obligations in a timely manner.
		</p>
		</li>

		<li>
		<p>
		I will not abuse alcohol or support alcohol abuse, nor will I<br>
		condone the use or possession of illegal substances of any kind.
		</p>
		</li>

		<li>
		<p>
		I will abide by the laws and policies of the country, state,<br>
		locality, and my university at all times.
		</p>
		</li>

		<li>
		<p>
		I will keep Chapter property safe, cleaned, and maintained.
		</p>
		</li>

		<li>
		<p>
		I will learn and understand the Ritual of Phi Kappa Sigma and<br>
		incorporate the ideals expressed by the Ritual in every day<br>
		life.
		</p>
		</li>

		<li>
		<p>
		I will abide by the Constitution and Acts and policies of the<br>
		Phi Kappa Sigma Fraternity and the By-laws and policies of the<br>
		Chapter to which I am affiliated.
		</p>
		</li>

		<li>
		<p>
		I will strive to keep my Chapter strong by actively<br>
		participating in recruitment.
		</p>
		</li>

		<li>
		<p>
		I will recognize that my responsibility to Phi Kappa Sigma<br>
		does not end upon graduation and I will always support the<br>
		Fraternity to the best of my ability.
		</p>
		</li>

		<li>
		<p>
		I will encourage and challenge other Skull's to abide by these<br>
		expectations and confront those who fail to do so.
		</p>
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		We take these obligations seriously, because a Skulls conduct<br>
		not only affects his personal reputation, but the reputation of<br>
		fellow Skulls, the Chapter, and the entire International<br>
		Fraternity as well.
